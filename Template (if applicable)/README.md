# CanCOGeN Data Collection Template

This data specification is currently only implemented through the DataHarmonizer.

## DataHarmonizer
The specification can be accessed through the [DataHarmonizer App](https://github.com/cidgoh/pathogen-genomics-package/releases). The [DataHarmonizer](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer) is a standardized browser-based spreadsheet editor and validator. Template name **"CanCOGeN SC2"**. Template schema files can be found as .yaml/.json/.tsv [here](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer/tree/master/web/templates/canada_covid19).

### Getting Started
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/cidgoh/pathogen-genomics-package/releases) and download the latest package.
2. Unzip the package.
3. Run by loading the index.html or main.html files in your local web browser.

### Select Template
The default template loaded is the "CanCOGeN Covid-19" template, so you shouldn't need to change this. If, however you work with multiple specifications you can change the spreadsheet template by selecting the white text box to the right of **Template**. An in-app window will appear that allows you to **Change template** by selecting from the available templates in the drop-down menu. After selecting the desired template, click **Open** to activate the template.
